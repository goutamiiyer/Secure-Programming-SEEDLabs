** THE PDF YOUR PARENTS WARNED YOU ABOUT II **

Another email in your inbox.
Doesn't seem overly suspicious.

That key should be around here somewhere...

U aren't alone.
Everyone seems to miss finding this in the challenge text

All things being equal,
Certain things don’t belong,
Knowing this, good luck!
